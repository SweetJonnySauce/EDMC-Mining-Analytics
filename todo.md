## Nice to haves
- If limpets are purchased check to see if the quantity is close to the total size of the cargo hold. If so, you could prep a "pre-mining" workflow. This could also be determined if the ship loadout has a prospector limpet and refinery.
- If possible get nearby prices and estimate the profit obtainable.
