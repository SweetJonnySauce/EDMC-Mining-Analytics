## Must haves
- After-action analytics report
- Send after-action mining report to discord webhook
- Fix the prospector lost logic.
- Subtract baseline qty from total mined.
- Record where you are mining

## Should haves
- % of asteroids where the commodity was present
- compare multiple runs

## Could haves
- When entering a ring, check EDSM to see if you know anything about the hotspot/location

## Nice to haves
- If limpets are purchased check to see if the quantity is close to the total size of the cargo hold. If so, you could prep a "pre-mining" workflow. This could also be determined if the ship loadout has a prospector limpet and refinery.
- If possible get nearby prices and estimate the profit obtainable.
