# EDMC Mining Analytics

EDMC Mining Analytics extends Elite Dangerous Market Connector (EDMC) with a mining-focused control panel. The plugin listens to in-game journal events to present live production metrics, highlight rock quality, and capture session history without leaving EDMC.

Please report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/SweetJonnySauce/EDMC-Mining-Analytics/issues). Your feedback helps shape the next release.

## Key Features
- Real-time mining dashboard showing cargo totals, tons-per-hour trends, limpets, refinements-per-minute to gauge your collection efficiency and ship context.
- Cross platform. Works on Windows and Linux.
- EDMCOverlay support built in. Track total tons per hour, RPM, % full, and limpets remaining on your HUD.
- Automated session management that starts, pauses, and resets analytics in response to journal events or user input, with optional auto-resume when activity resumes.
- Prospecting intelligence with duplicate detection, commodity histograms, and quick-glance content summaries for each asteroid.
- Integrations that help you act on the data, including Inara commodity lookups for nearest/best price (click on the commodity name in the table), EDSM lookup for reserve level and ring type, and Discord webhook summaries of completed runs.
- No in-game configurations needed. Simply install it as an EDMC plugin and restart EDMC.
- Optional warning that you are in a non-metallic ring (for those laser platinum miners)
- Configurable experience covering update cadence, histogram bin size, cargo capacity inference, logging retention, and alert thresholds.
- Optional JSON session archive for deeper analysis or sharing, retained locally according to your preferences.
- Nearby Hotspot finder with integrated real-time Spansh search: type-ahead system lookup, ring/signal filters, minimum hotspot threshold, and clipboard copy shortcuts for quick in-game paste.

## Requirements
- [Elite Dangerous Market Connector](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) 5.x or newer.

## Installation
1. Open EDMC and choose `File → Settings → Plugins`, then click `Open Plugins Folder` to reveal your plugins directory.
2. Download the latest release or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/SweetJonnySauce/EDMC-Mining-Analytics). Do **not** download individual files. Keep the directory structure intact (`integrations/`, `session_recorder.py`, `commodity_links.json`, etc.). 
3. Extract the `EDMC-Mining-Analytics` from the release .zip file and move it to the EDMC plugin directory.
4. Restart EDMC. The plugin appears under `Plugins → EDMC Mining Analytics` and adds a panel to the main window.

_To update, replace the contents of the `EDMC-Mining-Analytics` folder with the files from the latest release and restart EDMC._

## First Run & Configuration
- The plugin panel opens automatically in EDMC to view live metrics. The interface follows the active EDMC theme automatically with some noticable gaps that I have not been able to fix yet.
- Use the plugin preferences (within EDMC's Plugins tab) to adjust histogram bin size, refresh cadence, and refinement per minute (RPM) thresholds.
- Toggle automatic unpause behaviour, enable session logging, and define how many session files to retain.
- Configure Inara search mode and filters (carriers, surface ports) for one-click commodity lookups.
- Provide an optional Discord webhook URL and image links to deliver session summaries, and use the built-in test button to confirm connectivity.

## Using the Plugin
- Simply start mining. The plugin recognises mining states, begins tracking tonnage, and monitors prospecting and refinement events.
- Cargo updates and limpet usage are tracked automatically, including abandoned collectors and drones launched.
- Click the commodity in the Commodities column to do an Inara search for nearest/best price for selling.
- Click the value in the `% Range` column in the Commodities table to open histograms that visualise asteroid yield % distributions.
- When you leave mining (supercruise, manual reset, etc.), the session recorder can persist a JSON summary and optionally push a Discord embed.

## Support
Questions, ideas, or bugs? Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/SweetJonnySauce/EDMC-Mining-Analytics/issues). Feedback helps shape the next release. Yes, this project is 100% vibe coded using Codex. I'm doing it as an experiment/learning experience to see what is possible.
